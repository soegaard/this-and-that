; split-between : pred xs -> (list (list x ...) ...)
;   The list xs is split into sublists.
;   For all neighbors x1 and x2 in xs, (pred x1 x2) determines whether the list is split.
;   Example:  (split-between = (list 1 1 2 3 3))  =>  '((1 1) (2) (3 3))
(define (split-between pred xs)
  (let loop ([xs xs] [ys '()] [xss '()])
    (match xs
      [(list)                 (reverse (cons (reverse ys) xss))]
      [(list x)               (reverse (cons (reverse (cons x ys)) xss))]
      [(list x1 x2 more ...)  (if (pred x1 x2) 
                                  (loop more (list x2) (cons (reverse (cons x1 ys)) xss))
                                  (loop (cons x2 more) (cons x1 ys) xss))])))

; The following uses split-between to implement group-consecutives.
